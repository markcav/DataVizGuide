# DataVizGuide
provides common charts, when to use them, and code examples
 
| Charts (click for example)        | Description   | Examples|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:  |
|[Box and Whisker Plot](/DataVizGuide/box-and-whisker.ipynb)       | useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets. | ![box_plot](box_plot.png)   |
| [Histogram](/DataVizGuide/histogram.ipynb)      | useful for giving a rough view of the probability distribution| ![histogram](histogram.png)     |
| [Density Plots](/DataVizGuide/densityplot.ipynb) | advantage Density Plots have over Histograms is that they're better at determining the distribution shape because they're not affected by the number of bins used   | [density plot](density_plot.svg)      |
